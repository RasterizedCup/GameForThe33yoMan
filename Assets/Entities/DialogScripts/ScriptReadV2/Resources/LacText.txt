<Lacari>...
<Filian>So..
<Filian>What are you doing around these parts?
<Lacari>This is my home. It is where I reside. What brings you to my land?
<CHOICE>Your mom tbh|Can we talk about your attire first?..|I seek the fruit.|I'm trecking through the land in search of a weapon to fight the mott batallion.
<Filian>Your mom tbh
<Lacari>Watch your mouth you little rabies infected gremlin. It'd be best for you to say in my good graces.
<Filian>Lol okay dad.
<Lacari>Now.. Why are you actually here?
<RETURN>
<Filian>Can we talk about your attire first?..
<Lacari>What is there to say?
<Lacari>It's hot and humid out here.
<Lacari>I wear this because I want to cool down, and because it looks good on me.
<Filian>Fair enough I umm, I won't question it. You do you man.
<RETURN>
<Filian>I seek the fruit.
<Lacari>The fruit?
<Filian>Yeah, like apples and stuff. Nuts.
<Lacari>Nuts aren't fruit.
<Filian>Yes they are.
<Lacari>That doesn't make any sense though.
<Filian>But they are. I promise go look it up.
<Lacari>Alrighty. Maybe in a few.
<Filian>You def should it's kinda interesting.
<Lacari>I got you I got you. Now.. What does this have to do with why you're here?
<Filian>Uhh nothing I think, actually.
<Lacari>Then why'd you bring it up.
<Filian>Adhd go brrrr. You know how it is.
<Lacari>Moving on then.
<RETURN>
<Filian>I'm trecking through the land in search of a weapon to fight the mott batallion.
<Lacari>What a noble cause Filian. What exigency brings you to such an issue?
<Filian>They're taking over welches factories around the globe! Trying to overthrow everything I care about. The snackers are starving!
<Lacari>Oh man bro that's rough.
<Filian>Ye.
<Lacari>Well I believe you're on the right path. Trecking through these paths to come may be daunting, but I am sure you will find what you seek! Continue small crack-addicted one.
<Lacari>I'll make sure to be around if you find any loose fruit snack packs. I can convert them into special powers for you to use.
