DOCUMENTATION

Instructions for use:
	Prefabs are in the "Black hole/Prefabs" folder.
1) "BlackHoleSimple":
	Simple and lightweight version of shader, may not always look right.
	Objects in front of a black hole may appear in a distorted image, which may lead to
 	an incorrect image. 
	To create a black hole not from a prefab, create a new material by assigning it
	the "SpryGorgon/BlackHoleSimple" Shader, or use an existing material. Assign this material
	to an object with a spherical mesh.
2) "BlackHoleRealistic":
	A black hole simulation based on a more realistic model. Doesn't have the problem
 	described above, but is more resource-intensive. 
	To create a black hole not from a prefab, create a new material by assigning it
	the "SpryGorgon/BlackHoleRealistic" Shader, or use an existing material. Assign this material
	to an object with a spherical mesh. Then click on the object, hover over the "Light" tab
 	and create a child "Reflection Probe". For the Blackhole's "Mesh Renderer" component, specify "Blend Samples"
	in the "Light Samples" and "Reflection Samples" fields. In the "Anchor Override" field, assign
 	Transform of the child "Reflection Probe". If you don't know how to configure "Reflection Probe"
 	better,	the documentation is available online (https://docs.unity3d.com/ru/current/Manual/class-ReflectionProbe.html)


Description of "BlackHoleLight.shader" properties:
	Design: "No Halo" or "Halo":
		"No Halo" - Design version with "Gravitational lensing" effect, no "halo" effect
		"Halo" - Design version with "Gravitational lensing" effect and "halo" effect
	Camera type: "Orthographic" or "Perspective":
		"Orthographic" - The appearance is drawn correctly for orthographic cameras
		"Perspective" - The appearance is drawn correctly for perspective cameras
	Horizon Width - Width of all parts excluding singularity
	[Halo]Halo Color - Halo color in the new version of the design
	[Halo]Bright Light Color - Color of the photon sphere in the design with "halo"
	[Halo]Halo Thickness - Width of the "floating" part of the accretion disk in the design with "halo"
	[Halo]Width Of Motionless Light - Width of the "non-floating" part of the accretion disk in the design with "halo"
	[Halo]Width Of Oscillating Light - Width of the "floating" part of the accretion disk in the design with "halo"
	[Halo]Light Speed - The speed of light oscillation in the "floating" part of the accretion disk in the design with "halo"
	[Halo]Light Brightness - Ligth brightness in the design with "halo"
	[Halo]Noise - The noise texture used to generate oscillating light in the design with "halo"
	Distortion Factor - The degree of light deflection during gravitational lensing
	Smoothness Factor - Smoothing light deflection in gravitational lensing (scale of deflection of all rays)

	Probes Blending - Enable this option if you are not using a child "Reflection Probe", but use other ones placed around the scene, and if you want to achieve a smooth transition of the image between external probes.
